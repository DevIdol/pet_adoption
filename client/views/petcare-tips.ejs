            As a pet parent you want to do everything you can to care for your
            pet; this involves regular, everyday activities to ensure they stay
            happy and healthy. Practice these ten responsible pet care tips year
            after year for a lifetime of happy and healthy cats and dogs.
          </p>
          <h4>1. Veterinarian Visits</h4>
          <p>
            Responsible pet ownership starts with regular visits to the
            veterinarian. Given their shorter-than-human lifespan, your dog or
            cat should be getting a checkup at least once or twice a year.
            Depending on your pet's vaccination schedule, they may go more
            frequently when they're young, but establishing and maintaining good
            pet health means keeping up with vet visits as they age.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trips to the vet can be, shall we say, challenging. Cats, in
            particular, may be averse to leaving the comfy confines of their
            home, but there are ways to reduce stress for both of you.
            Acclimating your cat to her carrier when she is a kitten is good
            practice (and avoids the running-away-and-hiding-under-the-bed
            scenario). Dogs tend to like going for car rides. Take your pup on
            joyrides, so he won't associate getting into the car with going to
            the vet. And many pets don't mind a trip to the veterinarian's
            office, especially if you choose a vet that's a good fit for your
            little friend.
          </p>

          <h4>2. Vaccinations</h4>
          <p>
            Vaccinating your pets is a vital component of responsible pet care.
            Soon after welcoming your new pet into your home, schedule an
            immunization appointment. During your first visit, the vet will set
            up an immunization schedule for your little pup or kitten to protect
            them from illness and disease. Vaccinations for puppies should
            happen early in your puppies first few weeks after you bring him
            home. Talk to your vet at your first appointment, on when a good
            time to schedule that visit. They help prevent diseases such as
            rabies, Lyme disease, and distemper. Cats benefit from vaccines that
            prevent feline herpes virus, feline leukemia, and rabies. If you've
            adopted an adult or senior animal, make sure they are immunized,
            too. Vaccinations do need renewal and aren't just for young pets.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Proper Identification</h4>

          <p>
            If the unthinkable happens and your little guy or gal gets lost —
            youngsters in particular are prone to dashing out the door — having
            proper identification is the key to a happy ending. Start with the
            basics: a safe collar, and a tag that contains all of your contact
            information. In addition to an ID tag, microchipping your pet is
            advisable, because there's always the chance a collar will fall off.
            The microchip, an electronic device about the size and shape of a
            grain of rice, is implanted under your pet's skin and can be read by
            a scanner that pulls up your identification information. A
            combination of these forms of identification will go a long way to
            reuniting you and your beloved pet, but only if you keep your
            contact information up-to-date. Be sure to change your information
            on file with the microchip if you have a change in address or phone
            number.

          />
          <h4>4. Spaying/Neutering</h4>
          <p>
            Sterilizing your pet prevents a host of health problems, including
            complicated pregnancies, and reduces the number of homeless animals.
            Spaying your kitty (removing the uterus and ovaries) greatly reduces
            her risk for cervical cancer, eliminates the risk of ovarian cancer,
            and prevents her from going into "heat." That minimizes the chance
            that she'll stray from home in search of a partner, and any nearby
            male cats will be less aggressive (and they won't spray to mark
            their territory, something that benefits you and your furniture).
            Neutering your puppy helps alleviate aggression and roaming the
            neighborhood, and will prevent him from getting testicular cancer.
            Because spaying or neutering is surgery that requires general
            anesthesia, your pet will likely stay overnight at the vet's office
            for at least one night for observation and recuperation.
          </p>

          <h4>5. Healthy Food</h4>
          <p>
            Two connected elements of responsible pet ownership include
            providing animals with fresh, cool water and healthy food at all
            times. The right pet food will enrich your best buddy's life,
            providing them with the energy and nutrients they need. With so many
            meal options to choose from, it can be daunting, but you can become
            adept in no time by familiarizing yourself with important
            ingredients and how they help your pup or kitty. When choosing the
            best cat food, look for a good balance of protein, carbs and fats.
            These are important ingredients for dog food, too, as is plenty of
            fiber for the digestive system. In addition to healthy ingredients,
            select a pet food formula that is appropriate for your pet's age,
            health conditions and activity level, and speak to your vet before
            switching your pet to a specialized food.
          </p>

          <h4>6. At-Home Care</h4>
          <p>
            As your pets' caretaker, your job is to provide them with good
            hygiene habits at home as well as at the vet's or groomer's.
            Brushing their teeth, combing their coats and providing them with
            healthy food all keeps them in tip-top shape. To stay on track with
            responsible pet care, schedule hygiene and grooming tasks in your
            calendar and try combining tasks, such as a comforting comb after
            trimming nails, until it becomes routine.
          </p>

          <h4>7. Comfy Quarters</h4>
          <p>
            As the seasons change or you rearrange your living space, take a
            look around to see that you're providing your pet with a safe, cozy
            habitat. Dog bed looking a little flat? Buy your pup a new one.
            Litter box area not cutting it anymore? Spruce up your kitty's
            bathroom with a new box and scoop. This also is a good time to check
            for potential hazards. Look for exposed cords or wires (young
            animals find these to be great chew toys), secure safety gates,
            repair loose windows or screens and remove any plants that are
            poisonous to your pet.
          </p>

          <h4>8. Training and Socializing</h4>
          <p>
            One of the most important aspects of responsible pet care is
            ensuring your dog or cat is well-trained, and proper socializing is
            a part of that. Starting when they're young is best and most
            effective, but it's never too late to learn new tricks. Toilet
            training is the number one priority for any animal with whom you
            share your home, as is working on obedience training. Learning
            socialization skills will help your puppy or kitten bond with you
            and with other pets. Ask your vet or local animal shelter for
            recommendations for good trainers in your area or at-home training
            guides to read. A well-trained pet is a happy pet, and that
            translates to a happy pet parent.

          />

          <h4>9. Following Dog Park Rules</h4>
          <p>
            Taking your dog outside to play is one heck of a good time, and,
            being the social creatures they are, dogs love a good romp outdoors.
            If you decide to take your pup to a dog park, abide by the posted
            rules. Proper dog park etiquette, such as bringing your own toys and
            not bringing in food, keeps everyone safe, especially if a dog is
            aggressive or under-socialized. Bring along treats for afterward to
            reward your guy for his good behavior. Vets also recommend that you
            wait until your dog is at least four months old before bringing him
            to the dog park to ensure he's vaccinated before being exposed to
            other animals.
          </p>

          <h4>10. Safe Playtime</h4>
          <p>
            It's no secret that dogs and cats love to play, and it's an
            effective relationship-building activity. Take stock of their toys.
            Are they safe? Be mindful of threadbare stuffed toys that pose
            choking hazards and hard, sharp edges that could cause injury. Throw
            away and replace playthings that are worn out. Making DIY cat toys
            and dog toys is a great, inexpensive way to bring even more fun to
            pet parenting! Remember, these tips aren't applicable just during
            pet holidays — make them part of your regular pet parenting role,
            and you and your pets will reap the benefits for a lifetime!
