          <p>
            One of the most important and rewarding things you can do as a pet
            parent is to train your dog well, but it’s often hard to know how to
            get started. Since January is national Train Your Dog Month, we
            thought we’d share some handy tips to help you and your pup get
            going.

          <h4 class="side-h4">1. Use positive reinforcement techniques</h4>
          <p>
            Almost all vets agree that positive reinforcement training is the
            most effective method of dog training. Positive reinforcement
            training essentially focuses on rewarding your pet for good
            behavior, rather than punishing bad behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever your dog demonstrates good behavior and responds positively
            to your commands, reward them! By rewarding good behavior, you’re
            reinforcing the association between good behavior and good things.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s also important to make sure you’re not inadvertently rewarding
            unwanted behavior. For example, if your dog barks at you to play or
            jumps up to say hello, don’t acknowledge it or give in, as this just
            reinforces the bad behavior. Instead, wait until they’re calmer
            before giving them attention.
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">2. Find the right reward.</h4>
          <p>
            Some dogs are food-motivated, and will respond very enthusiastically
            to any sort of edible treat as a reward. Others are pickier: often,
            soft, chewy treats are preferred to hard, crunchy ones. Some dogs,
            however, just aren’t that interested in food at all. If this is the
            case with your pup, try experimenting with other rewards, like a
            quick play session with a favorite toy, or even just plenty of
            affection.
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">3. Consistency is key.</h4>
          <p>
            Being consistent in your training is incredibly important. This
            includes consistency in how you’re training your dog—for example,
            always using the same word, and even the same kind of intonation,
            when asking them to do something.
          </p>
          <p>
            Equally important is for everyone in your household to be on the
            same page. Dogs need consistency to learn new habits, so if you
            never let the dog on the couch, but your partner does, your pup will
            just end up confused.

            allowfullscreen
          ></iframe>

          <h4 class="side-h4">4. Train little and often.</h4>
          <p>
            Short training sessions repeated throughout the day are much more
            effective than longer ones. The American Kennel Club recommends
            keeping sessions to five minutes maximum; any longer and your dog
            may become distracted or frustrated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dogs also often struggle to generalize commands to other places or
            situations (i.e., understanding that asking for a “sit” at home is
            the same thing as a “sit” on a busy street), so it’s useful to
            repeat your training sessions in multiple locations, with different
            people and with varying levels of distraction, so that your pup
            learns to respond correctly to the same command all the time.
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">5. Build up in stages.</h4>
          <p>
            Starting small can be helpful, particularly when it comes to more
            complex behaviors like “stay,” or with behavior modification (when
            you’re trying to get rid of unwanted behavior). Try breaking
            behaviors down into smaller parts. For example, in the beginning, if
            you’re training “come,” praise and reward your dog when they take
            even one step towards you. It’s much easier to add on steps and
            build up to the whole behavior once your pup starts to get the hang
            of it.
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">6. Make it fun.</h4>
          <p>
            Training should be fun, both for you and your dog! Always keep it
            positive, and try mixing things up to keep it interesting, such as
            incorporating short play sessions into your training in between
            repetitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could also consider training your dog to do tricks in addition
            to regular obedience training. As humans, we naturally respond more
            enthusiastically to seeing a dog rolling over than we will to a
            plain old sit—our dogs pick up on that enthusiasm and end up loving
            to perform tricks for us!
          </p>

          <h3 class="easy-h3">
            It’s easy to get caught up in the end goal of training, but remember
            to praise your dog for any small improvement.
          </h3>

          <h4 class="side-h4">7. Praise the small things.</h4>
          <p>
            Remember to always praise your dog for any improvement, no matter
            how small. It’s easy to get caught up in the end goal of training,
            but celebrating the little wins is just as important, and will help
            keep both you and your dog motivated.
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">8. Work training into daily life.</h4>
          <p>
            By making training part of your usual pet routine, it’s a lot easier
            to fit in many small sessions. For example, ask your dog to sit or
            respond to another command before you give them their dinner, take
            them out for a walk, or play with them.

            allowfullscreen
          ></iframe>

          <h4 class="side-h4">9. Use your hands.</h4>
          <p>
            Much as we’d wish they could, dogs can’t understand language the
            same way we do. Many dogs respond better to hand signals than verbal
            commands, so try combining the two, or even begin with only hand
            signals and add the verbal command later.
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">
            10. Consult a dog trainer or attend a training class.
          </h4>
          <p>
            If you’re struggling, don’t hesitate to contact a professional dog
            trainer or join a training class. Generally one of the fastest ways
            to get results, professional trainers have years of knowledge they
            can use to help you and your pup. They will have experienced many
            different types of problems in their career, so they should have
            ideas on how to address any issues you may be facing.
          </p>
          <p>
            When choosing a trainer, take your time to do a little research.
            Make sure they use positive reinforcement techniques, and read
            plenty of reviews or get references if you can.
