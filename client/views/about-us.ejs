              search for a pet that best matches their needs. They can then
              reference a shelterâ€™s web page and discover what services it
              offers. Petfinder also includes discussion forums, a pet-care
              resource directory and a library of free pet-care articles to help

              Our website is only a directory of homeless pets and pet adoption
              people. No information in this site is guaranteed. Although the
              information on website is updated frequently, it is always best to
              call the facility or organization that lists the pet to insure it
              is still available and to insure the information listed in our
              website is accurate.

              It is crucial that any pet found through an adoption service be
              thoroughly examined by a veterinarian immediately upon adoption.

              responsibility of the adoption organizations and/or the adopting
              party.
