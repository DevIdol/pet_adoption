          <h4>Reasons Why Cat Training is Important</h4>
          <p>
            Contrary to popular belief, cats do require mental and physical
            enrichment. If not given proper stimulation, cats can become bored,
            which then leads to problems such as destructive behavior, weight
            gain, depression, and other health issues. Training requires your
            cat to problem solve while also increasing their movement, which
            makes it an excellent form of both mental and physical exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Training with your cat will alsohelp to strengthen the bond the two
            of you share. It gives you a fun activity to do together, and it
            builds trust. As you work with your cat, you'll get a deeper
            understanding of their personality, their body language, and how
            their mind works. This understanding will build a closer
            relationship and be helpful in other areas of your cat's life as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last but not least, training your cat can eliminate undesirable or
            problem behaviors. As mentioned, bored cats can become destructive,
            so if this is something your cat struggles with, training can help!
            You can also use clicker training to correct problem behavior such
            as unwanted scratching, biting, and counter surfing.

          <h4 class="side-h4">Sit</h4>
          <p>
            Teaching your cat to sit is quite easy and doesn't usually take much
            time at all. All you have to do is capture your cat's "sit" by
            clicking and rewarding whenever they do it naturally. Pair it with a
            hand signal and voice cue, and eventually your cat will learn to do
            it on command.

          <h4 class="side-h4">Coming when called</h4>
          <p>
            Teaching your cat to come when called, also known as recall, is a
            useful skill. Not only is it nice when your cat comes when you call
            their name, it can also come in handy if your cat were to ever slip
            out of your house. Basically, you just need to use treats to entice
            your cat to come when you call their name and always reward when it
            happens.

          <h4 class="side-h4">Problem Behaviors</h4>
          <p>
            If your cat has a problem with things like biting, scratching, or
            counter surfing, don't worry! You can correct your cat's behavior
            with proper training.
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">Biting</h4>
          <p>
            The first step to correcting biting behavior is to figure out why
            it's happening as different situations will require different
            treatment plan. If your cat is playing rough and biting during
            playtime, try to keep them calm by interrupting play sessions before
            your cat gets too overstimulated. This strategy is no different than
            interrupting wrestling matches with dogs at the dog park and asking
            them to do some sits and stays to take a breather from play. The
            goal is never to punish the behavior, but instead prevent it from
            occurring in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Biting can also occur when your cat is bored and not getting enough
            mental or physical activity. Provide them with the means to act on
            their predatory instincts with toys they can chase, bite, and catch.
            Engaging in training sessions can help curb the biting behavior by
            teaching your cat self-control.
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">Furniture scratching</h4>
          <p>
            Scratching is an instinctual and natural behavior, that is important
            for your cat. If your cat is scratching your couch, the best way to
            correct this behavior is to provide them with plenty of other
            equally or more appealing scratching surfaces and use positive
            reinforcement to encourage them to make the correct choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Place the scratchers in various areas of your home, and also beside
            the piece of furniture they tend to gravitate towards and make them
            as enticing as possible, for example, with catnip and using your
            clicker to reward your cat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cover your furniture so you don't need to get frustrated with your
            cat during the training process. Fortunately, today, it's so much
            easier to find beautiful couch covers to protect furniture and make
            your home more cat-friendly,
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">Tricks</h4>
          <p>
            There are SO many fun tricks you can teach your cat. Trick training
            is a great way to engage with your cat and strengthen your
            relationship. Many of the tricks require prerequisite skills like
            target training or sit, so be sure your cat has mastered those
            skills first.
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">Spin</h4>
          <p>
            To teach "spin" you'll need to use either a target stick or your
            finger to lead your cat around in a tight circle. Pair this behavior
            with the "spin" command, a click as the trick as performed, and
            reward with a treat!
          </p>

          ></iframe>

          <h4 class="side-h4">Jump</h4>
          <p>
            You can teach your cat to jump up onto objects on command by using
            the target stick to lead your cat. Just as with "spin," you'll want
            to combine with a voice command and then click and reward when
            executed successfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use the target stick to lead your cat to jump over obstacles
            a s well, such as your legs or your arms. Eventually you can even
            try teaching your cat to jump through your arms like in this
            tutorial video

          <h4 class="side-h4">High five</h4>
          <p>
            Nobody can resist a cute kitty who high-fives! The training process
            for this trick has a few steps involving cups and sticky notes, so
            be sure to check out this tutorial video:

          <h4 class="side-h4">Cat Training FAQs</h4>
          <h4 class="side-h4">What if my cat isn't food motivated?</h4>
          <p>
            If your cat isn't willing to work for treats, it could be that you
            haven't found the right treat yet! Test out some different treat
            options to find one that your cat deems worthy and give your cat a
            chance to get used the new food; some cats are scared to try
            anything new.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your cat's feeding schedule is also a big part of the equation. If
            your cat free feeds (meaning they have a bowl of food available at
            all times), they won't usually be very food motivated because they
            can just snack whenever they want. Adjusting your cat's feeding
            schedule from free-feeding to planned, portioned meals will make a
            big difference in their willingness to work for treats!
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">What if I have multiple cats?</h4>
          <p>
            It is possible to train multiple cats at a time! It is a bit more to
            manage though, so if possible, it's recommended to start with one
            cat at a time. Training multiple cats simultaneously requires some
            prerequisite skills such as mat and/or chair training, as well as
            distractions such as food puzzles and/or snuffle mats.
          </p>

          <h4 class="side-h4">Which behavior should I start with?</h4>
          <p>
            You should start with a new behavior that's easy, such as target
            training or "sit." Knowing how and when to build on your skills can
            be tricky though, which is why we have a step-by-step training
            roadmap to follow in our online Cat School Course! It will guide you
            through the training process in a logical progression, eliminating
            the any guess work on your part as to where to start and where to go
            next.
