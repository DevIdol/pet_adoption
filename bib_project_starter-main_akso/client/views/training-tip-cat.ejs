    <h4>Reasons Why Cat Training is Important</h4>
    <p>
      Contrary to popular belief, cats do require mental and physical enrichment. If not given proper stimulation, cats can become bored, which then leads to problems such as destructive behavior, weight gain, depression, and other health issues. Training requires your cat to problem solve while also increasing their movement,
      which makes it an excellent form of both mental and physical exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Training with your cat will alsohelp to strengthen the bond the two of you share. It gives you a fun activity to do together, and it builds trust. As you work with your cat, you'll get a deeper understanding of their personality, their body language, and how their mind works. This understanding will
      build a closer relationship and be helpful in other areas of your cat's life as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last but not least, training your cat can eliminate undesirable or problem behaviors. As mentioned, bored cats can become destructive, so if this is something your cat struggles with, training can help! You can also use clicker training to correct
      problem behavior such as unwanted scratching, biting, and counter surfing.

    <h4 class="side-h4">Sit</h4>
    <p>
      Teaching your cat to sit is quite easy and doesn't usually take much time at all. All you have to do is capture your cat's "sit" by clicking and rewarding whenever they do it naturally. Pair it with
      a hand signal and voice cue, and eventually your cat will learn to do it on command.
    </p>

    <h4 class="side-h4">Coming when called</h4>
    <p>
      Teaching your cat to come when called, also known as recall, is a useful skill. Not only is it nice when your cat comes when you call their name, it can also come in handy if your cat were to ever slip out of your house. Basically, you just need to use treats
      to entice your cat to come when you call their name and always reward when it happens.

    <h4 class="side-h4">Problem Behaviors</h4>
    <p>
      If your cat has a problem with things like biting, scratching, or counter surfing,
      don't worry! You can correct your cat's behavior with proper training.
    </p>

    <h4 class="side-h4">Biting</h4>
    <p>
      The first step to correcting biting behavior is to figure out why it's happening as different situations will require different treatment plan. If your cat is playing rough and biting during playtime, try to keep them calm by interrupting play sessions before your cat gets too overstimulated. This strategy is no different than interrupting wrestling matches with dogs at the dog park and asking them to do some sits and stays to take a breather from play. The goal is
      never to punish the behavior, but instead prevent it from occurring in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biting can also occur when your cat is bored and not getting enough mental or physical activity. Provide them with the means to act on their predatory instincts with toys they can chase, bite, and catch. Engaging in
      training sessions can help curb the biting behavior by teaching your cat self-control.
    </p>

    <h4 class="side-h4">Furniture scratching</h4>
    <p>
      Scratching is an instinctual and natural behavior, that is important for your cat. If your cat is scratching your couch, the best way to correct this behavior is to provide them with plenty of other equally or more appealing scratching
      surfaces and use positive reinforcement to encourage them to make the correct choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Place the scratchers in various areas of your home, and also beside the piece of furniture they tend to gravitate towards and make them as enticing as possible,
      for example, with catnip and using your clicker to reward your cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cover your furniture so you don't need to get frustrated with your cat during the training process. Fortunately, today, it's so much easier to find beautiful couch
      covers to protect furniture and make your home more cat-friendly,
    </p>

    <h4 class="side-h4">Tricks</h4>
    <p>
      There are SO many fun tricks you can teach your cat. Trick training is a great way to engage with your cat and strengthen your relationship. Many of the tricks require prerequisite skills
      like target training or sit, so be sure your cat has mastered those skills first.
    </p>

    <h4 class="side-h4">
      Spin
    </h4>
    <p>
      To teach "spin" you'll need to use either a target stick or your finger to lead your cat around in a tight circle. Pair this behavior
      with the "spin" command, a click as the trick as performed, and reward with a treat!
    </p>
    <p>

    <h4 class="side-h4">Jump</h4>
    <p>
      You can teach your cat to jump up onto objects on command by using the target stick to lead your cat. Just as with "spin," you'll want
      to combine with a voice command and then click and reward when executed successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use the target stick to lead your cat to jump over obstacles a
      s well, such as your legs or your arms. Eventually you can even try teaching your cat to jump through your arms like in this tutorial video

    <h4 class="side-h4">
      High five
    </h4>
    <p>
      Nobody can resist a cute kitty who high-fives! The training process for this trick has a few steps
       involving cups and sticky notes, so be sure to check out this tutorial video:

    <h4 class="side-h4">Cat Training FAQs</h4>
    <h4 class="side-h4">What if my cat isn't food motivated?</h4>
    <p>
      If your cat isn't willing to work for treats, it could be that you haven't found the right treat yet! Test out some different treat options to find one that your cat deems worthy and give your cat
       a chance to get used the new food; some cats are scared to try anything new.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your cat's feeding schedule is also a big part of the equation. If your cat free feeds (meaning they have a bowl of food available at all times), they won't usually be very food motivated because they can just snack whenever they want. Adjusting your cat's feeding schedule from free-feeding to planned,
       portioned meals will make a big difference in their willingness to work for treats! 
    </p>

    <h4 class="side-h4">
      What if I have multiple cats?
    </h4>
    <p>
      It is possible to train multiple cats at a time! It is a bit more to manage though, so if possible, it's recommended to start with one cat at a time. Training multiple cats simultaneously requires some prerequisite skills such as mat and/or chair training,
       as well as distractions such as food puzzles and/or snuffle mats.
    </p>

    <h4 class="side-h4">
      Which behavior should I start with?
    </h4>
    <p>
      You should start with a new behavior that's easy, such as target training or "sit." Knowing how and when to build on your skills can be tricky though, which is why we have a step-by-step training roadmap to follow in our online Cat School Course! It will guide you through the training process in a logical progression,
       eliminating the any guess work on your part as to where to start and where to go next.
